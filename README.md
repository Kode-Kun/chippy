# C8ke

`c8ke` *(pronounced "cake")* is an emulator of the [chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) architecture, written completely in C, with graphics and windowing done with [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).

`c8ke` implements the SUPER-CHIP specification, as it is the most well-documented one.
It aims to be fully compatible with, at the very least, any program written using the [octo](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo) assembler.
